# ABAP Universal Object Creation and Dispatch Pattern

## Overview

This repository provides a robust and flexible design pattern for Object-Oriented (OO) ABAP development. Its primary purpose is to decouple object instantiation and method invocation from the client code, allowing for highly configurable and extensible applications. By leveraging a central factory, interface-based programming, and SAP's enhancement technologies, this pattern promotes cleaner code, easier maintenance, and greater adaptability to changing business requirements.

The benefits include:
-   **Reduced Coupling**: Client code interacts with interfaces, not concrete implementations, making it easier to swap implementations.
-   **Enhanced Flexibility**: Object creation logic is centralized and can be configured through tables or enhanced via BAdIs without code modification.
-   **Improved Testability**: Clear separation of concerns and interface-based design simplify unit testing.
-   **Standardized Enhancement**: Provides a clear path for custom enhancements through BAdIs and configuration.

## Key Features

-   **Factory Pattern**: A central factory class (`ZANDERS_CF_OBJECT`) handles the creation of all registered objects.
-   **Interface-Based Programming**: Extensive use of interfaces (`ZANDERS_IF_...`) for defining contracts and enabling polymorphism.
-   **BAdI Integration**: Seamless integration with SAP's Business Add-In (BAdI) framework for custom enhancements to the class resolution logic.
-   **Configurability via `ZANDERS_IF_IMPL` Table**: A dedicated transparent table (`ZANDERS_IF_IMPL`) allows developers to define mappings between interfaces, object keys, and their implementing classes.
-   **Unit Testing Support**: The design encourages unit testing, and some demo classes include local test classes using the ABAP Unit framework.

## Core Components

-   **`ZANDERS_CF_OBJECT` (Class)**: The heart of the pattern. This factory class is responsible for instantiating and returning objects based on an interface name and an optional object key. It contains the logic for the class resolution strategy.
-   **`ZANDERS_IF_IMPL` (Table)**: A customizing table where mappings between interface names, object keys, and implementing class names are maintained. This allows for runtime determination of object implementations.
-   **`ZANDERS_IF_OBJ_INIT` (Interface)**: A common initialization interface that should be implemented by classes managed by this pattern. It typically includes an `INIT` method that can accept parameters (e.g., from XML) to set the initial state of the object.
-   **Business Interfaces (e.g., `ZANDERS_IF_BUS1`, `ZANDERS_IF_CHECK`)**: Define the specific contracts for different business functionalities.
-   **Business Classes (e.g., `ZANDERS_CL_BUS1`, `ZANDERS_CL_CHECK`)**: Concrete implementations of the business interfaces.

## How it Works

The `ZANDERS_CF_OBJECT` factory employs a prioritized class resolution strategy to determine which concrete class to instantiate for a given interface and object key:

1.  **BAdI (Business Add-In) Implementation**: The factory first checks if a BAdI implementation exists for the given interface and object key. If found, the BAdI determines the implementing class name. This offers the highest level of customization.
2.  **Specific Configuration (`ZANDERS_IF_IMPL`)**: If no BAdI implementation is found or active, the factory queries the `ZANDERS_IF_IMPL` table for an entry matching the specific interface name and object key.
3.  **Generic Configuration (`ZANDERS_IF_IMPL`)**: If no specific entry is found, the factory searches `ZANDERS_IF_IMPL` for a generic entry, typically using a wildcard for the object key (e.g., `*`) for the given interface.
4.  **Default Naming Convention**: If none of the above yield a result, the factory falls back to a default naming convention (e.g., replacing `IF_` or `ZIF_` in the interface name with `CL_` or `ZCL_` respectively to derive the class name).

Once the class name is determined, the factory creates an instance of that class. If the class implements `ZANDERS_IF_OBJ_INIT`, its `INIT` method is called, potentially passing initialization data.

## Getting Started / Installation

This project is designed to be installed using [abapGit](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit), an open-source Git client for ABAP.

1.  **Install abapGit**: If you don't have abapGit installed in your SAP system, follow the installation instructions on the official abapGit website.
2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    *   In your SAP system, run abapGit.
    *   Click on "New Online" (or similar, depending on your abapGit version).
    *   Enter the Git clone URL of this repository.
    *   Choose a package (e.g., `$TMP` for local testing or a transportable package for wider use).
    *   Click "Create" and then "Pull" to import the objects.

All objects, including classes, interfaces, data dictionary elements, and function groups, will be created in your system.

## Using the Demo Objects

The repository includes demo objects to illustrate the pattern's usage:

-   **`ZANDERS_CL_BUS1`**: A sample business class implementing `ZANDERS_IF_BUS1` and `ZANDERS_IF_OBJ_INIT`. Its `INIT` method can process XML data, and its `DISPLAY` method (from `ZANDERS_IF_BUS1`) shows its internal state.
-   **`ZANDERS_CL_CHECK`**: Another sample class implementing `ZANDERS_IF_CHECK` and `ZANDERS_IF_OBJ_INIT`. Its `CHECK` method performs a simple validation.
-   **`ZANDERS_TEST_BUS1` (Program)**: A sample program demonstrating how to use the factory `ZANDERS_CF_OBJECT` to get instances of business objects and call their methods.

To test:
1.  Examine the `ZANDERS_TEST_BUS1` program to see how the factory is called.
2.  You might need to create entries in the `ZANDERS_IF_IMPL` table (via SE16 or SM30 if a maintenance view is provided) to map interfaces like `ZANDERS_IF_BUS1` to classes like `ZANDERS_CL_BUS1` for specific object keys.
3.  Run the `ZANDERS_TEST_BUS1` program or your own test programs.

## Running Tests

Several classes in this repository include local test classes for use with the ABAP Unit testing framework. For example, `ZANDERS_CL_BUS1_ENH` contains `lcl_test` in its `*.testclasses.abap` include.

To run these tests:
1.  Open the class containing the test methods in SE24 or ABAP Development Tools (ADT).
2.  In ADT, right-click on the class or the test include and select "Run As" -> "ABAP Unit Test".
3.  In SE24 (or SE80), navigate to the "Local Test Classes" tab (or the test include) and use the menu option "Goto" -> "Local Test Classes" -> "Execute Tests" or press Ctrl+Shift+F10.

The results of the unit tests will be displayed, indicating whether the implemented logic behaves as expected.
